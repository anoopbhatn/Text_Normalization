    In speech-applications such as text-to-speech (TTS) or automatic speech recognition
    (ASR), text normalization refers to the task of converting from a written representation
    into a representation of how the text is to be spoken. In all real-world speech applications,
    the text normalization engine is developed in large partâ€”by hand.

    As many of us can attest, learning another language is tough. Picking up on nuances like
    slang, dates and times, and local expressions, can often be a distinguishing factor between
    proficiency and fluency. This challenge iseven more difficult for a machine.
    Many speech and language applications, including text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) and
    automatic speech recognition (ASR), require text to be converted from written
    expressions into appropriate "spoken" forms. This is a process known as text
    normalization, and helps convert 12:47 to "twelve forty-seven" and $3.16 into "three
    dollars, sixteen cents."

    However, one of the biggest challenges when developing a TTS or ASR system for a new
    language is to develop and test the grammar for all these rules, a task that requires quite a
    bit of linguistic sophistication and native speaker intuition.

    An example :
    <br/><br/>
    To lay the groundwork for discussion let us consider a simple example such as the
    following:
    <br/><br/>
    <b>A baby giraffe is 6 ft tall and weighs 150 lb.</b> 
    <br/><br/>
</p>
<p>
    If one were to ask a speaker of English to read this sentence, or if one were to feed it to an
    English TTS ( Text To Speech ) system one would expect that it to be read more or less as
    follows:

<br/>

<table border="0" align="center">
        <tr>
            <td>a</td>
            <td>--></td>
            <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;(self)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>baby</td>
            <td>--></td>
            <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;(self)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>giraffe</td>
            <td>--></td>
            <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;(self)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>is</td>
            <td>--></td>
            <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;(self)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>6ft</td>
            <td>--></td>
            <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;six feet</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>tall</td>
            <td>--></td>
            <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;(self)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>and</td>
            <td>--></td>
            <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;(self)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>weighs</td>
            <td>--></td>
            <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;(self)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>150lb</td>
            <td>--></td>
            <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;one hundred <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp; fifty pounds</td>
        </tr>
</table>
<br/>

<p>
    In the original written form there are two non-standard words, namely the two measure
    expressions 6ft and 150lb. In order to read the text, each of these must be normalized into
    a sequence of ordinary words. In this case both examples are instances of the same
    semiotic class, namely measure phrases. But in general texts may include non-standard
    word sequences from a variety of different semiotic classes, including measures, currency
    amounts, dates, times, telephone numbers, cardinal or ordinal numbers, fractions, among
    many others. Each of these involves a specific function mapping between the written
    input form and the spoken output form.
